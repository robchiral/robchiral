        <p>My two-week infrastructure tour of Germany.</p>
<p>In May I visited Germany for the second time since 2015, when I visited Berlin and Munich. Since 2015, my German level has improved from B1 to C1, Angela Merkel stepped down, and BER was completed. Unfortunately, Stuttgart 21 remains incomplete its opening has recently been postponed until 2026.</p>
<p>I travelled between JFK and FRA on SQ&rsquo;s fifth-freedom route; I was able to book round trip in J for only $2252 with their student discount. While SQ flight attendants greet you by name, the food was mediocre on both flights and amenity kits must be requested. The B777 hard product is outdated and feels somewhat cramped if you are not in the bulkhead seat (bookable starting 48 hours before depature). Further, SQ&rsquo;s lounge offering in JFK T4 (Primeclass) is terrible compared to its offering in FRA T1 (Lufthansa Business Lounge). Overall Condor seems like a much better value proposition on this route.</p>
<p>After arriving in FRA in the morning, I spent the day exploring the Altstadt, the several pedestrian bridges crossing the Main, and the Geldmuseum der Deutschen Bundesbank. I then spent the night near Galluswarte, and in the morning took RB68 to Heidelberg.</p>
<p>In Heidelberg I spent the morning exploring the Heidelberg Castle area, where a funicular carries you between the Altstadt, the Castle, and the hilltop (Koenigstuhl). The Castle also has a nice pharmacy museum attached with preserved specimens. After briefly stopping at the university and visiting the old student prison (Studentenkarzer), I crossed the Alte Brucke, enjoyed the view of the Neckar, and walked along the Philosophenweg.</p>
<p>The morning after I went to Stuttgart via RE73 (Heidelberg-Bruchsal) and IRE1 (Bruchsal-Stuttgart). I regret not booking the ICE for this route as it would have taken half as long. I had developed a sore throat the night before and had forgotten to bring ibuprofen; in Germany ibuprofen can only be purchased at pharmacies, and as it was a Sunday I had to visit a Notapotheke (an on-call pharmacy so to speak). Unfortunately the Stadtbibliothek was also closed, but I was still able to visit the BMW and Porsche museums. As someone who is not a car fan, I found both museums mediocre, with the BMW museum being much larger and having more diverse exhibits than the Porsche museum.</p>
<p>After spending the night in Stuttgart-Feuerbach, a mixed residential/industrial area in the north of the city, I travelled to Freiburg via ICE. Interestingly DB did not offer a direct Stuttgart-Freiburg service when I visited; instead I had to backtrack to Mannheim and transfer there. I had very high expectations for Freiburg after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vil5KC7Bl0">Not Just Bike&rsquo;s video</a> but was rather disappointed. Immediately upon arriving I found that the trams were on a bridge above street level and the escalator was not working, meaning passengers needed to carry heavy luggage above three flights of stairs. Unlike in Frankfurt and Stuttgart, tram stops are also very close together even outside the immediate city center, meaning they are rather slow. After depositing my luggage I went to the Schauinslandbahn, which requires a bus transfer after reaching the end of tram line 2; apparently there are plans to extend tram line 2 all the way but they have not materialized yet. The views from the top of Schauinsland were nice but the observation tower was closed indefinitely. I then returned to the city and walked around the Altstadt, where I had a slice of Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte.</p>
<p>The next day I took the ICE to Koeln, with a transfer in Mannheim. The tracks leading into Koeln HBF are highly congested and we were delayed for 30 minutes.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.callabike.de/en/home">Call a Bike</a>: Call a Bike is DB&rsquo;s bike rental service and costs only €5.90 per month for unlimited 30 minute rides. The same membership can be used across numerous cities in Germany, although you will need a separate membership for Hamburg, Lüneburg, and Stuttgart.</li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/rena2019/a2d32769a685ed26c3e3b3bbfe151859">Deutschlandticket anomalies</a>: The Deutschlandticket can be purchased from several retailers, but some offer additional perks. If you plan on visiting Freiburg, I would recommend purchasing from VAG as you will receive a discount on the Schauinslandbahn as well as free 30 minute Frelo bike rentals. It is important that you cancel your subscription prior to the 15th of the month, otherwise you will need to pay for the following month.</li>
<li><a href="https://fraenk.de/">Fraenk</a>: Fraenk provides 12 GB 5G data for €10 per month, has eSIM compatibility, and can be activated while you are outside the EU.</li>
